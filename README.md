# 🏠 SCT_ML_1 – House Price Prediction Project

This project is part of my internship at **Skillcraft Technology**. It is a simple **machine learning-based house price predictor** with a user-friendly interface built using **Streamlit**.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

**SCT_ML_1** is a regression-based model that predicts house prices based on several input features like:

- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Living area (sq. ft)
- House condition
- Number of nearby schools

The model is deployed using `Streamlit` for real-time predictions through a web-based interface.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **Streamlit**
- **scikit-learn**
- **NumPy**
- **joblib**

---

## 🧠 Skills Gained

- ML model development using regression
- Deploying models with Streamlit
- Using `joblib` to save and load trained models
- Designing interactive user interfaces
- Real-world application of machine learning
